The dataset I am interested is Fetal Health Classification, which is used to classifying fetal health in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. As we know, to reduce the child mortality rate is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress. There is the expectation that by the year of 2030, the preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age is aiming to reduce under 5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births for all countries. Parallel to notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality, which accounts for 295000 deaths during and following pregnancy and childbirth as the year of 2017. The vast majority of these infant deaths (approximately 94%) occurred in low-resource settings, and most could have been prevented. Considering what was mentioned above, the dataset uses the cardiotocograms (CTGs), which are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health by allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.

This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetricians into 3 classes: Normal, Suspect, Pathological. Among the data, we have 21 features including baseline fetal heart rate, uterine contractions and so on. I am willing to use this dataset to make do data visualization and detailed demographic plot to show the association between covariates and dependent outcomes.  Also, to demonstrate the information for each baseline covariates.  I can learn to use not only R such as ggplot, but also python and other software to do data visualization. Also, I am willing to do the predication and classification of fetal health by using different method like parametric model such as by fitting the proportional odds model or non-parametric model such as classification method. Then we can compare the performance of the parametric and non-parametric model. Also, I want to learn some method like machining learning such as decision tree, supervised machine learning classification and deep learning methods. Moreover, the ultimate goal is to improve the performance of the predictions for the fetal mortality by utilizing the diagnostic information and check the model performance and do validations such as k-fold validation. Besides, I want to learn how to use docker to reproduce the whole demographic report and classification model by using one line of code in docker. In this class, my goal is to learn some machine learning methods to do classification and how to organize my code and files so that I can share to other people, and they can easily repeat my analysis with less efforts.
